# Unit testing using Vitest

A school project where I wrote tests for different functions. The tests are written in Jest and I used Vitest.

## Usage

### To run the application

Run `npm install` to install all packages and then start the Vite dev-server using `npm run dev`.

### To run the tests

Run `npm run test` to run the tests in the terminal and alternatively run `npm run test:verbose` for more information about the tests. To get a code coverage report run `npm run coverage`.
